# firebase-live-chat

### A real time chat application using Google Firebase and Google OAuth.

Updated to allow links and images through urls. Supports inline png, gif, jpg, and jpeg images. In current state the hyperlinks that show up when an image is posted are dead if there is a message posted along with the image, but clicking the image itself will open the url in a new tab.
